  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Added push_surfacing_results_from_cache() to Reply proxy. This allows
    a scope to reply the results of the last succesful surfacing query
    from an on-disk cache.  This is useful to prevent the user being
    presented with an empty screen when swiping to the scope while the
    device has no network access, or the scope's data source is off-line.

    PreviewQueryBase::run().

  * Suppressed warning for arm build and updated comment regarding
    alignment.
  * Added valgrind suppression for leak in net-cpp. Added work-around
    for valgrind complaint about invalid envp being passed when calling

    SS.Registry.Endpoint, which is where the smart scopes proxy server
    is expected to provide its registry object. If these keys are not

  * Added ability for scope to push an exception (as an exception_ptr). On the client side,
    the exception is delivered as the what() string (if the exception is a std::exception) and
    as "unknown exception", otherwise.
  * Disabled running the tests in parallel for CI. They are not written
    to run concurrently because the different tests try to bind to the
    same network endpoints. This should almost certainly fix the failure
    reported here:
    https://launchpadlibrarian.net/159997415/buildlog_ubuntu-saucy-
    i386.unity-scopes-api_0.1.5-0~94~ubuntu13.10.1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz.
  * Got rid of chatter from helgrind. (Needs helgrind 3.9.0 or later--
    3.8.1 generates bogus errors.) Added public destroy() method so it
    is possible to shut down the reaper explicitly. Fixed race condition
    on setting the self_ weak_ptr.
  * Changed code to match macro change here:
    https://code.launchpad.net/~michihenning/unity-api/noncopyable-
    fix/+merge/200084 Also removed remaining remnants of deprecated
    NonCopyable class.
  * Added CMake option to build with -fsanitize=thread. Fixed a bunch of
    warnings when building with clang.
  * Fixed valgrind error in HttpClient_test.cpp: execv was using
    deallocated memory. Updated CTestCustom.cmake.in to correctly
    suppress the tests that should not be run under valgrind.
  * Fixed shutdown in ObjectAdapter and added proper exception handling
    if the broker thread or a worker thread encounters an exception.
  * Disabled code generation for stand-alone header compilation tests.
    This makes the tests run marginally faster.
  * Added locate() remote method to the Registry, for the scope
    activation logic.
  * Changed ScopeLoader to not run the scope in a separate thread. (This
    is done by scoperunner anyway.) This fixes the problem of an
    exception being thrown by start(), but the scoperunner not realizing
    this. (LP: #1262536)
  * Added suppressions file for thread sanitizer issues in zmq.
  * Fixed race on registry start-up: registry was answering incoming
    requests too early. Other minor cosmetic changes: replaced
    factory()->create() call with factory()->find() because RuntimeImpl
    already instantiates the middleware. Removed redundant #includes.
    (LP: #1267026)
  * Minor fix: got rid of unnecessary unique_ptr. No functional changes.
  * Added formatcode target to CMakeLists.txt. This runs all source and
    header files through a pretty-printer.
  * Updated code for API changes in latest Cap'n Proto. (LP: #1268538)
  * Added check to prevent two servers from binding to the same ipc
    endpoint. Added coverage test for double-bind. Removed attempts to
    deal with servant destructors that throw. It turns out that this
    doesn't work because the destructor is called in the context of the
    map destructor, which calls the shared_ptr destructors, so we end up
    in terminate(). I might theoretically be possible to do this with a
    custom deleter for the map and the shared_ptrs inside the map, but
    the trouble isn't worth it. Destructors should never throw, that's
    just how it is, and attempts to patch around that are a lost labor
    of love. (LP: #1257676)
  * Fix to stop SignalThread from spinning if waitpid() is called at a
    point where there are no child processes. (LP: #1268524)

  * Added ping() method to all proxies.

  * Fix use of uninitialised variable.
  * Use lowercased build type.
  * Use the macro version of noncopyable.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Fixed typo in CMakeLists.txt error message.
  * Made changes required by new API for exceptions in unity-api:
    https://code.launchpad.net/~michihenning/unity-api/what-

unity-scopes-api (0.1.3+14.04.20131211-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Bump version because of the ResultItem rename.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Added Result::metadata() getter. Create null Variant with default ctor.
  * Introduced a base Result class which carries base result attributes
    and CategorisedResult class that carries Result + a category and
    replaces existing ResultItem class. Provide methods to store a
    Result inside a Result. Changed the internal structure of serialized
    Result to use "attrs" and "internal" dicts inside the outer dict.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * This fixes a race condition that could cause the thread pool
    accessor on the middleware to return nullptr.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Add a simple API to launch a scope without going through the dlopen
    based scope runner for the benefit of language bindings.

unity-scopes-api (0.1.1+14.04.20131204-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Prepare for PPA release
  * Added upstart job for the scope registry.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Added CategoryRenderer class that encapsulates a json string with
    actual category template.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Make the option for -Werror apply to plain C too.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Added scope metadata to config and registry. Optional fields that
    are not set throw on an attempt to access them. This allows us to
    distinguish "not set all" from "set to default value". Simplified
    configuration. Factory.ini no longer exists. Client can now run
    without Runtime.ini, but still needs Registry.ini and Zmq.ini. (It
    looks for those in the current directory.) Will fix this next.
    Various minor clean-up in tests and doc comments.
  * Made it optional for client to specify a name, so multiple clients
    can run concurrently without stepping on each other. Removed no-
    longer-needed source file I should have removed in previous commit.

unity-scopes-api (0.1+14.04.20131127-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Initial release
  * Improved notes in INSTALL file.
  * Fixed scoperegistry to use new scoperunner and to figure out which
    scopes to run from config files. Still to do: deal with overrides
    and OEM scopes, particularly the grouping aspect. SignalThread needs
    to invoke a callback for clean shut-down on receipt of SIGINT.
  * Added reason for why a call to finished() is made (finished,
    cancelled, or error). Fixed incorrect return value from push() after
    cancellation. Lots of doc fixes and other minor tidy-up.
  * Made proxies properly polymorphic, so they derived from a common
    base and no longer redudantly store the pimpl and the MWProxy at
    each level of the hierarchy.

  * Automatic snapshot from revision 52 (bootstrap)
  * Format should be 1.0, not sure why I switched it invalidly
  * Re-copyright sources to fit the LGPL-3 license. It's good to have
    all sources in one license to avoid confusion - and I guess LGPL-3
    was supposed to be the main one. Also, I guess Lzmqnse is a typo of
    License, yes?.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Added requires for libunity-api to the pc file, so that linking
    works properly when using unity exceptions.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Implemented support for categories. Added double and array support
    to the Variant class.
  * Added support for null Variant.
  * Renamed ReplyBase to ReceiverBase. Pass ResultItem by value to
    ReceiverBase::push.
  * First cut at scopes tutorial. Moved move ctor and move assignment
    operator of ResultItem from the header file to .cpp to avoid ABI
    issues in the future. Renamed 'icon' to 'art' in ResultItem.
  * Added category setter to ResultItem.

  [ Jussi Pakkanen ]
  * Merged capnp fixes.
  * Quote quotes.
  * Use unique_ptrs for holding impl objects instead of shared_ptrs
    where possible.
  * Clang usability fixes.
